# 2D Car Racing Game

A simple yet engaging 2D car racing game developed in C++ using OpenGL and GLUT. The player controls a car in a top-down view and must avoid oncoming traffic while accumulating points. 

## üéÆ How to Play

- **Start Game**: Press `SPACE`
- **Move Car**:  
  - `LEFT ARROW`: Move left  
  - `RIGHT ARROW`: Move right  
- **Control Speed**:  
  - `UP ARROW`: Increase speed  
  - `DOWN ARROW`: Decrease speed  
- **Exit**: Press `ESC`
